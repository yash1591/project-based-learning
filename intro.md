🐍 Welcome to Python Programming!

Python is one of the easiest and most powerful programming languages to learn.
Let’s start with the basics:

# This is a simple Python program
print("Hello, World!")  # It prints text on the screen


✅ Key Points:

print() is used to display output.

Lines starting with # are comments (they are ignored by the computer).

Python uses indentation (spaces or tabs) to define code blocks.
